# BigMacIndex-Happiness
In this notebook, we are exploring the correlation of a country's Big Mac Index to its overall happiness.

The Big Mac index is an economic measurement of consumer purchasing power by comparing the price of a single Big Mac in other countries to the cost of a Big Mac in the United States. The Purchasing Power Parity(PPP) theory suggests that a product or good will cost the same across all countries after converting to their local currency. However, this is an ideal situation and in reality there are currencies that are overvalued(they pay more in USD) and undervalued(they pay less in USD). The Big Mac Index is fun way to get an approximate measurement of global buying power since the Big Mac is a common item that is sold across over 150+ countries and is essentially made the same way.

### Hypothesis:

**Null:** There is no correlation between a country's Big Mac Index and its overall happiness.

**Alternative:** There is a correlation between a country's Big Mac Index and its overall happiness.
